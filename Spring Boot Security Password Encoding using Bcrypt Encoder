What is Bcrypt Encoding

As per wiki, bcrypt is a password hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res, based on the Blowfish cipher. Bcrypt uses adaptive hash algorithm to store password.BCrypt internally generates a random salt while encoding passwords and hence it is obvious to get different encoded results for the same string.But one common thing is that everytime it generates a String of length 60.


You can also take a look into this Online Bcrypt Tool to know how bcrypt works.


First of all let us give a look into the program that will Bcrypt any given password.We will be storing the first result to the DB.


package com.devglan.config;

import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;

public class BcryptGenerator {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		int i = 0;
		while (i < 5) {
			String password = "password";
			BCryptPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
			String hashedPassword = passwordEncoder.encode(password);

			System.out.println(hashedPassword);
			i++;
		}

	  }
}
